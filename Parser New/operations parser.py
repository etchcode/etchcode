from pyparsing import Word, nums, oneOf, Literal, operatorPrecedence, alphas, opAssoc

integer = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda t:int(t[0]))
variable = Word(alphas,exact=1)
operand = integer | variable

expop = Literal('^')
signop = oneOf('+ -')
multop = oneOf('* /')
plusop = oneOf('+ -')
factop = Literal('!')

# To use the operatorGrammar helper:
#   1.  Define the "atom" operand term of the grammar.
#       For this simple grammar, the smallest operand is either
#       and integer or a variable.  This will be the first argument
#       to the operatorGrammar method.
#   2.  Define a list of tuples for each level of operator
#       precendence.  Each tuple is of the form
#       (opExpr, numTerms, rightLeftAssoc, parseAction), where
#       - opExpr is the pyparsing expression for the operator;
#          may also be a string, which will be converted to a Literal
#       - numTerms is the number of terms for this operator (must
#          be 1 or 2)
#       - rightLeftAssoc is the indicator whether the operator is
#          right or left associative, using the pyparsing-defined
#          constants opAssoc.RIGHT and opAssoc.LEFT.
#       - parseAction is the parse action to be associated with
#          expressions matching this operator expression (the
#          parse action tuple member may be omitted)
#   3.  Call operatorGrammar passing the operand expression and
#       the operator precedence list, and save the returned value
#       as the generated pyparsing expression.  You can then use
#       this expression to parse input strings, or incorporate it
#       into a larger, more complex grammar.
