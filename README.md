# Etch Code
Etch Code allows you to create Scratch programs using an equivalent written language. For instance, your program could look like
```
flag clicked:
	say("hi")
	move(10 * 10)
```
This helps you both write Scratch programs more efficiently and eases the transition from Scratch into  a written language. Specifically, Etch Code programs are written similarly to Python programs.

Get more information and try it out at [etchcode.org](http://etchcode.org). (It is in Alpha now, so it won't always work.)

Note: Technically, you are writing [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu) programs, which have a few more features than Scrach does. I refer to the programs as Scratch programs because of the overwhelming difference in popularity. Thank you to the Snap! team for open sourcing your project, Etch Code uses Snap! to run Etch Code projects.
