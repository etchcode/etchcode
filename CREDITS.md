# Credits 
====================

## This project is build on the heads of giants. We especially want to thank

1. The Snap! team. Without their work, this would have been impossible. Their code takes an XML file from us, and from that renders the interactive sprite-based game-ish-thing that the creator made. See (https://github.com/ucb-snap/) for license information and more.
2. The Scratch team, for the idea that started it all
3. Google and the AngularJS team for the incredible AngularJS, without which this would have been a much greater undertaking. See (http//angularjs.org) for license information and more.
4. Flask, which the server side of etch is built in.
5. Google App Engine, the hosting for etchcode
