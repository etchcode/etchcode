        Etch is a language that aims to make the transition from Scratch to a written language easier.
        It is intended for people who feel that the have exhausted what they can do with Scratch, but are not ready for a language like Python or Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Etch, you write out your code instead of dragging blocks in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Etch is designed to be easy to use for people who are moderate to advanced in Scratch.
