                Etch is a language that aims to make the transition from Scratch to a written language easier.
                It is intended for people who feel that the have exhausted what they can do with Scratch, but are not ready for a language like Python or Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Etch, you write out your code instead of dragging blocks in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Etch is designed to be easy to use for people who are moderate to advanced in Scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Etch is built in the spare time of high school students <a href="http://danielzfranklin.org">Daniel Franklin</a> and <a href="http://samschickler.com">Sam Schickler</a>.
