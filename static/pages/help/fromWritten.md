Etch's syntax is much looser than most other languages as capitalization and spaces are irrelevant. `flagclicked` equals `flagClicked` equals `flag clicked` equals `FLAG CLICKED`. The idea behind this is to minimize some types of stupid syntax errors and keep what a person coming from Scratch must memorize to a minimium.

Blocks that have other blocks inside of them are written like blocks in python

    flag clicked
        say("hi") # this line is indented one tab inwards
        
Strings, integers, and functions are written just as they are in almost every other language

    1                  # integer
    "Hello World"      # string
    say("Hello World") # function
    
We don't yet support defining functions or "more blocks." Let us know if you have any ideas for how it should work.
